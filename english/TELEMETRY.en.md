# ðŸ“Š Telemetry Test

## Objective

Confirm whether the `Kojiro.exe` executable makes network connections (possible telemetry) while running, using only local tools without relying on external software.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Active Process Check

The following PowerShell command was executed to verify if `Kojiro.exe` was running:

```powershell
tasklist | findstr "Kojiro.exe"
```

### 2. Port Inspection Using netstat

The following PIDs were identified during analysis:

- PID 2656
- PID 3252
- PID 12956
- PID 1432

### 3. Network Traffic Check Using Windows Resource Monitor

The Resource Monitor (`resmon.exe`) was opened and the **Network** tab was used, filtering by the `Kojiro.exe` process.
